# Clause-CLI
Command Line Interface for Secret Santa

<b> How it works </b>

Clause CLI serves as a hub for your Secret Santa exchange.
It allows groups to chat anonymously (1-way) and manage their own wishlists.
It also handles drawing names and counting down to the final exhange day.

<b> Creating/Joining a Group </b>

If you are the first one in your group to use Clause CLI, you will have to Create a Group.
Here, you will choose your Group Name, and the date of your exchange.
Everyone in a group will have a unique name and password - these are what you use to access your wishlist updater and chat log.

<b> Navigating the Interface </b>

In the main menu, your basic options are to <i>Chat</i> or view a <i>Wishlist</i>.
When you are in one of these interfaces, simply follow the prompts on screen.
At any time, you may type <i>exit</i> to return to the previous context.

<b> Chatting </b>

You can open the chat manager by typing 'chat'.
Here, you can chat with anyone in your group - when you do, you will appear as an anonymous animal to them.
Similarly, anyone in the group can anonymously chat with you, and they will appear in your chat log as a random animal.

<b> Wishlists </b>

You can open the wishlist manager by typing 'wishlist'.
Here, you can view the wishlist of anyone in the group.
If you view your own wishlist, you will be provided with the option to add or remove an item from your list.
When you add items to your list, you can also provide links for easy access.
